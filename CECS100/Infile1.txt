The History of Path Separators

Why is the path separator a / on Unix/Linux/MacOS systems and \ on Microsoft Windows systems? The concept of a hierarchy of folders was first developed in Unix. On a Unix command line a / is used to separate folder names in a file path and dashes are used to specify command line options, e.g., path/to/file/myfile -long -reverse. On a Windows system the / character is used for command line options, so the designers of Windows decided to use the \ for separating folder names in a file path, e.g., path\to\file\myfile /long /reverse. Using a \ to separate folder names in a path is problematic because the \ character is also used as an escape character for special characters, such as \n for a new line character. Bottom line, we will always use the / character to separate folder names in a path, and even on Windows system the file path will work just fine.
